# OpenPGP Card store

This is an experimental Private Key Store that enables clients to
access and use cryptographic keys stored on OpenPGP Cards.

The operations are only private key operations (decryption, signing,
ECDH derivation).

There is no configuration as this store automatically detects all
cards connected to the system and selects appropriate one based on
client's request.

WARNING: This is not production ready! Most importantly the crate
leaks data in the capability URLs (in production systems all private
data should be encrypted).
